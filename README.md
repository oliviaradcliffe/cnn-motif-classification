CNN for DNA motif sequence classification task

Simple 1-D CNN implementa�on for a DNA sequence classification task using Python and TensorFlow/Keras. For this problem, the model is trained to predict whether a given sequence contains the motif patern. Various value for the motif_patern variable and the length of the random_sequence are used to test the model with diﬀerent motifs and sequence lengths. The accuracy on the test set is printed after training the model.
